# Project that I am working on at Institute

This is where most of my projects are stored, but many of them have been lost. Here are some `Java` projects. I have also done `Web` projects.

## About the School

I studied at the [Bray Institute of Further Education  (BIFE)](https://bife.ie). The Institute is located in Bray, Ireland. This is [`Computer Software Development`](https://www.bife.ie/full-time-courses/computing-and-engineering/computer-software-development) course ([Link from web.archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20231109155715/https://www.bife.ie/full-time-courses/computing-and-engineering/computer-software-development) because the original link is not working). I studied there from 2022 to 2023 (1 year).

This is only one Website I saved.

#### CoffeeShop

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On another repo, may be updated in the future.

I completed the `CoffeeShop` `Web` project. It is stored in [another repository](https://github.com/DanyilT/WebDev/tree/main/CoffeeShop), and can look at [GitHub Pages](https://danyilt.github.io/WebDev/CoffeeShop).

### Unity 3D ([Multimedia Authoring](Multimedia%20Authoring))

In this module, we learned `Unity 3D` and `C#`, and worked on `AR` (Augmented Reality). We delved deeper into AR, but not into Game Design.

#### ChillZone

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On another repo, may be updated in the future.

We had a `Unity 3D` `AR (Augmented Reality)` project. It is stored in [another repository](https://github.com/DanyilT/ChillZone), more about this project you can find in the [Web Page](https://danyilt.github.io/WebDev/ChillZone).
